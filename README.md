### Service for tracking and recording completed tasks.

Service has a input field where user enters the task and add it to the list. User can use a checkmark to mark task as completed then task will turn green and 
and move to the end of the list. User can also uncomplete the task by pressing green checkmark.
All tasks are stored in a local storage so they are not updated when the page is reloaded.
